# Today I Learned

This is a repo of markdown documents to record new things I learn
and a place to keep track of things I would like to learn more about.

I heard about this idea from [veekaybee](https://github.com/veekaybee/til),
who was inspired by [thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
