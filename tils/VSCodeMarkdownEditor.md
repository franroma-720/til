# VSCode Markdown Editor

If you are editing a .md file in VSCode and you select Ctrl+Shift+V (replace Ctrl with command on a mac), it will preview the rendered markdown for you.

AND THEN YOU CAN PUT THE .MD AND THE PREVIEW WINDOWS SIDE BY SIDE AND THE PREVIEW WILL UPDATE LIVE IN FRONT OF YOU WHEN YOU EDIT THE MD.
